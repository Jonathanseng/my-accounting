Historic cost principal accounting is an accounting method that records assets and liabilities at their historical cost. 
This means that the value of an asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet at the price that it was originally purchased or incurred, 
regardless of its current market value.

There are several reasons why historic cost principal accounting is used. First, it is a reliable method of accounting. 
The historical cost of an asset or liability is easy to verify and can be used to track the company's financial performance over time. 
Second, historic cost principal accounting is conservative. It does not reflect any potential gains or losses that may occur in the future, 
which can help to protect investors from unexpected losses
