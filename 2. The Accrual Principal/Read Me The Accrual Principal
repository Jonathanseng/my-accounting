Your organisation ships goods to a customer in one accounting period but receives payment for them in the following accounting period. When should it record the sale in its accounts?

According to the accrual principle, you should:

Recognise income when it’s earned, regardless of when you receive it; and Recognise expenses when you incur them, regardless of when you pay them.

Recognition of transactions in financial statements is tied to when the relevant business activities take place, not the date when money changes hands. 

So, in the example above, the sale would be recorded in your organisation’s accounts in the accounting period for the date it shipped the goods to the customer.
