The principle of substance over form is an accounting concept that emphasizes the economic or underlying substance of a transaction or event rather than its legal or formal form. It focuses on the economic reality and essence of a transaction, rather than solely relying on its legal or contractual aspects.

In accounting, the principle of substance over form is used to ensure that financial statements accurately represent the economic reality of a business transaction or event, even if the legal form or contractual arrangements may suggest otherwise.

Here's an example of how the principle of substance over form can be applied in accounting:

Suppose a company enters into a sale and leaseback arrangement for an asset it owns. Under the legal form, the company sells the asset to another party and simultaneously leases it back. The legal documentation might indicate a sale, but the substance of the transaction might be that the company retains all the risks and rewards associated with ownership.

In applying the principle of substance over form, the accounting treatment would focus on the economic reality of the transaction rather than just the legal form. If the substance of the transaction indicates that the company retains control and risks associated with the asset, the company may need to account for it as a financing arrangement or as if it still owns the asset.

By prioritizing substance over form, the principle helps ensure that financial statements reflect the economic reality of transactions and events, providing users with a more accurate and meaningful representation of a company's financial position and performance.

It's important to note that the principle of substance over form requires professional judgment and careful analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding a transaction or event. It is guided by accounting standards and principles, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which provide guidance on the application of this principle in various accounting situations.
